### An analysis on the whole person on subject - 07

This case concerns a 25-year-old male who exhibits intense psychopathic ideations, stemming from his involvement in a series of homicides. We find this case particularly compelling, as he hails from a stable family background and has supportive relationships; however, he remains unable to overcome the grief and trauma of losing his father. This unresolved grief appears to fuel his pursuit of further murders, targeting individuals he deems "unworthy."

The purpose of this article is to present the cognitive map and whole body perspective of the patient and to examine the therapeutic processes attempted. We will focus on the factors contributing to his resistance to therapy and the challenges encountered in achieving therapeutic goals.

### Literature Review
Standard Beckian CBT, also called cognitive therapy (CT), is
based on the cognitive model, which links cognitions, emotions,
and behaviors such that cognitions shape behaviors and
emotions, and unrealistic cognitions can lead to inappropriate
emotions and behaviors [1]. CT is a structured or semi-structured,
directive, active and short-term approach. Its clinical use is
applied to several psychiatric disorders i.e., anxiety-, personality-
and eating-disorders, several situations of crises and disorders
related to the use of psychoactive substances [2].

Most approaches to CI agree to its basic principles which
include that people develop adaptable and non-adaptable
behaviors and affective patterns through cognitive processes,
the functions of these cognitive processes can be activated by the
same procedures that are commonly used in the human learning
laboratory, and the task for a therapist is that of a diagnostician
and pedagogue who evaluates dysfunctional cognitive processes
and arranges such learning experiences that transform the
existing cognitive patterns, and correlate them with behaviors
and patterns of experiencing things [3,4].

CT’s goals are to restructure the dysfunctional cognitions
and give cognitive flexibility when assessing specific situations
and to solve focal problems and mainly to provide patients with
cognitive strategies to perceive and respond in a functional
way to the real world [5]. CT is considered to have results with
issues related to depression and panic disorders, i.e. verbal and
non-verbal communication skills, assertiveness, criticizing and
receiving criticism, refusing alcohol, and in general saying no [6].

### Personal and family history
Villiam Von Auceptin was the second child in his family, with an older brother, William Von Auceptin, who is a renowned guard in our city. The family appeared stable until the tragic death and assault of their father. After these events, Villiam became rebellious, undisciplined, and was often labeled the “problem child” by his family. He struggled with communication, rarely spoke, and frequently exhibited signs of unresolved anger.

Despite their good financial standing, his family did everything possible to provide a safe environment for him. However, Villiam came to believe that the justice system had failed his family. Additionally, he felt overshadowed by his brother, whose reputation as a respected guardsman weighed heavily on him. When Villiam's behavior turned violent, the family became aware of his actions, but they felt pressured to keep his issues concealed.

By the time Villiam sought therapy, his situation was complex:

His mother, Elizabeth Van Der Straaten, came from a noble background, and along with his brother, pressured Villiam into seeking help. William often reminded him that there was no redemption to be found through his violent actions and that he would be unable to overcome his grief if he continued down his destructive path. Elizabeth, on the other hand, expressed mixed emotions: although she disapproved of his killings, she wanted Villiam to join the city guards and “channel his aggression lawfully.” This divide between the two most central figures in Villiam’s life left a deep and conflicting mark on his psyche.

The situation worsened when Villiam began to gain a following of people who saw him as a vigilante hero fighting “evil.” To Villiam's dismay, this following inspired copycat acts, resulting in the death of an innocent person. This tragedy made Villiam more unstable in his decision-making and undermined the progress he had made in therapy.

In summary, Villiam's family history reveals the intense pressure placed on him by his mother and brother to recover and “redeem” himself. He was seen by society and his family as both a villain and a hero. His brother’s insistence on him joining the guard only deepened Villiam's resentment, as he felt this training contributed to his darker tendencies. Following a prison sentence, which was controversially overturned due to public support, it is perhaps unsurprising that Villiam’s condition developed into full-blown psychopathy.

### Dysfunctional assumptions and rules
Dysfunctional assumptions and rules refer to general beliefs that individuals hold about themselves and the world, which predispose them to interpret specific situations in excessively negative and maladaptive ways. In cases of anxiety, most dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs often revolve around issues of acceptance, competence, responsibility, control, and the symptoms of anxiety themselves.

### Villiam’s Dysfunctional Assumptions and Beliefs

Villiam’s personal beliefs include:

1. _“The justice system failed my father.”_
2. _“I always have to protect my family.”_
3. _“I cannot cope with the death of my father.”_
4. _“If I cannot cope with this, I cannot cope with anything.”_
5. _“I always have to do everything perfectly; otherwise, others will look down on me.”_
6. _“I always have to do what my father would have wanted.”_
7. _“I have to be in control at all times.”_
8. _“If you are used to something, you cannot change.”_

These core beliefs have led Villiam to a series of automatic, negative thoughts, including:

1. _“I cannot get into the guards.”_
2. _“I cannot control this situation.”_
3. _“My mother will never be proud of me.”_
4. _“It’s too late for me to change.”_
5. _“I have no second chance.”_
6. _“Everything feels insurmountable.”_
7. _“I am tired of waiting for a better future.”_
8. _“I don’t want to sit by and do nothing.”_

### Goals of Treatment

- **Introduce the Cognitive Model and Whole Body Approach**
    
    - Explain the cognitive model of thought patterns and behaviors, using Villiam’s specific symptoms to demonstrate how vicious cycles perpetuate his distress and reinforce dysfunctional beliefs.
- **Identify and Challenge Automatic Thoughts**
    
    - Teach Villiam to recognize his automatic, negative thoughts and develop alternative, more adaptive ways of thinking. This approach will help him break free from rigid thought patterns and foster healthier emotional responses.
- **Develop Problem-Solving Skills**
    
    - Guide Villiam in reflecting on past failures and help him learn how to approach setbacks constructively. This aims to cultivate resilience and encourage a mindset open to new beginnings.
- **Establish Personal Identity**
    
    - Assist Villiam in forming a sense of self that is independent of his family’s expectations, reducing familial pressures and enabling him to define his own values and goals.
- **Cease Violent Behavior and Accept Accountability**
    
    - Support Villiam in ceasing his violent actions and considering accountability through a prison sentence as part of his rehabilitation. This promotes personal responsibility and lawful conduct.

### Behavioral and Cognitive Techniques Used

- **TIC-TOC Technique**
    
    - Villiam struggled to complete daily tasks without intrusive negative cognitions related to his father’s death and his own violent actions. The therapist introduced the “Task Inhibiting Cognitions” (TIC) technique, educating Villiam on how to monitor and challenge these dysfunctional thoughts, replacing them with “Task Oriented Cognitions” (TOC). For example, his automatic thought “I am a failure to my dad” was substituted with “If I don’t try, I have no chance of succeeding; if I do try, I at least have some possibility of success.”
- **Graded Exposure**
    
    - Exposure was introduced as a means to confront trauma-related avoidance, specifically Villiam’s PTSD around his father’s death. Villiam was encouraged to visit his father’s grave, accompanied by a guard, and to openly discuss the family trauma with his mother and brother. He successfully completed this task and gained a sense of peace, accepting that his father’s death was not his fault. Although he continued to feel some motivation for violence, this process seemed to bring him a measure of calm. Through repeated conversations about his father, significant progress was observed.
- **Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts**
    
    - Situations that triggered unpleasant emotions were recorded alongside Villiam’s emotional responses and the automatic thoughts that accompanied them. At a later stage, he learned techniques to challenge these thoughts. It should be noted, however, that Villiam remained unwilling to commit to any prison sentence.

### Conclusion

This case study presented the key tools and strategies used in treating Villiam’s psychopathic ideations, focusing on cognitive therapy principles including the Whole Body Approach. While we have seen notable improvements in Villiam’s cognitive behavior and character, we must regrettably conclude that, just before reaching a true breakthrough, Villiam discontinued treatment and appears to have disappeared from the city of Profeduar.

We hope for the opportunity to resume working with Mr. Villiam in the future to further advance our research and support his rehabilitation.
