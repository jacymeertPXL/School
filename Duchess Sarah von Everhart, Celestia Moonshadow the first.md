### An analysis on the Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) on my friend Sarah

This case concerns a 22-year-old lady of noble birth who exhibits intense Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and insomnia. This condition stems from her youth, during which she endured constant racism and immense pressure from the noble people around her. I find this case particularly compelling, as she is my personal friend, and we grew up together. Despite having supportive relationships, she continuously pushed herself to boundaries that no child or adult should. This unresolved determination appears to have fueled her pursuit of perfectionism and her efforts to navigate the complex dynamics of other noble houses.

The purpose of this paper is to assist my dear friend by presenting a clear cognitive map of her OCPD and the journey we have undergone together through various therapeutic steps. Over many months, we have worked to address the underlying factors contributing to her condition and have achieved positive results. This paper will focus on the key aspects of her therapy and the progress we have made.

### Literature Review
Standard Beckian Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), also referred to as cognitive therapy (CT), is based on the cognitive model, which posits that thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are interrelated. Dysfunctional cognitions can perpetuate maladaptive behaviors and emotional responses, particularly in patients with rigid and perfectionistic cognitive patterns, as often seen in Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). CT provides a structured, directive, and goal-oriented framework, making it a valuable approach for addressing OCPD’s core cognitive and behavioral features.

The cognitive-behavioral model of OCPD highlights the role of maladaptive core beliefs, such as fears of imperfection, excessive responsibility, and hyper-focus on orderliness and control. These cognitions manifest in behaviors such as over-preparation, procrastination due to perfectionism, and difficulty delegating tasks. Therapists employing CT in OCPD focus on identifying and challenging these beliefs, facilitating more adaptive cognitive and behavioral patterns.

Core principles of CT for OCPD involve recognizing how rigid cognitive processes drive excessive perfectionism and control-oriented behaviors. Therapy aims to help patients identify and reframe dysfunctional thoughts, replacing them with flexible, realistic cognitions. Behavioral experiments and exposure techniques are often employed to address avoidance behaviors and reinforce functional responses to feared situations, such as tolerating imperfection or delegating tasks.

In addition to CT, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is an evidence-based therapeutic approach commonly used to target obsessive-compulsive tendencies and rigid behavioral patterns. While traditionally associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), ERP can also be adapted for OCPD to help patients confront and tolerate discomfort associated with relinquishing control or embracing imperfection. ERP involves systematically exposing patients to situations or outcomes that trigger distress and guiding them to resist the compulsion to over-control or perfect the situation.

The integration of ERP into OCPD treatment focuses on gradually reducing reliance on rigid routines or perfectionistic behaviors. For example, patients may practice leaving a task “unfinished” or intentionally delegating work to others without interference. Over time, ERP helps to desensitize patients to the anxiety caused by these situations, allowing for greater flexibility in thoughts and behaviors.

The goals of CT and ERP for OCPD include fostering cognitive flexibility, reducing the need for excessive control, and promoting healthier interpersonal functioning. By developing strategies to balance perfectionistic tendencies with realistic expectations and addressing the emotional distress associated with rigidity, patients can achieve a better quality of life. Empirical evidence suggests that combining CT and ERP can improve outcomes by addressing both the cognitive and behavioral aspects of OCPD, such as reducing interpersonal conflicts and improving time management and decision-making skills.

### Personal and family history
Duchess Sarah von Everhart, also known as Celestia Moonshadow, is the firstborn child in her family, with a younger sister who is about four years her junior. She is currently studying as the second successor to the family business, following in Sarah's footsteps. Despite the family's stable noble status, they endured significant challenges due to pervasive racism and misogyny. The family’s situation worsened when several public deals were illegally broken and taken from them, causing their noble standing to gradually crumble.

At a young age—between 10 and 12—Sarah witnessed these events unfold, which profoundly shaped her. She dedicated her life to studying a wide array of subjects to prepare herself as the successor who could restore her family’s legacy. Her parents were unwavering in their support, investing every last penny they had in her education. This gave Sarah the capability to excel in nearly anything she pursued. However, the relentless pursuit of excellence came at a cost: she often studied to the point of exhaustion and fainting, leaving little time for play during our shared childhood.

As she grew older and began to assume responsibilities in the family business, she sought my advice regarding her worsening mental state. Over time, we diagnosed her with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and insomnia. While her condition improved through consistent effort, there was a significant setback later in life. Sarah, my dear friend, developed romantic feelings for me. Although she is a noble and loving individual, I do not share romantic feelings for women, and this unrequited affection caused her condition to worsen briefly. Despite this, we remained close friends.

Together, we endured the challenges of rebuilding her family's legacy, and by the age of 22, we succeeded. This paper will explore her journey, focusing on the factors that contributed to her condition, the therapeutic steps we undertook, and the positive outcomes we achieved.

### Dysfunctional assumptions and rules
Dysfunctional assumptions and rules refer to general beliefs that individuals hold about themselves and the world, which predispose them to interpret specific situations in excessively negative and maladaptive ways. In cases of anxiety, most dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs often revolve around issues of acceptance, competence, responsibility, control, and the symptoms of anxiety themselves.

### ### Sarah’s Dysfunctional Assumptions and Beliefs (Expanded)

Sarah’s personal beliefs include:

1. _“I must prove my worth to preserve my family's legacy.”_
2. _“Failure is unacceptable; it will dishonor my family.”_
3. _“I have to be perfect to overcome the discrimination we face.”_
4. _“If I show weakness, others will exploit it.”_
5. _“I am responsible for fixing the mistakes of my predecessors.”_
6. _“I must sacrifice my personal happiness to succeed.”_
7. _“Love is a distraction I cannot afford.”_
8. _“I am only as valuable as my achievements.”_
9. _“I have to endure pain and exhaustion to prove my dedication.”_
10. _“Others’ judgment of me defines my worth.”_
11. _“If I don’t constantly improve, I will fall behind and lose everything.”_

### Automatic Negative Thoughts

These core beliefs have led Sarah to experience a series of automatic, negative thoughts, including:

1. _“I can never rest; there is always more to do.”_
2. _“If I don’t succeed, my family will be ruined.”_
3. _“I cannot afford to let anyone down.”_
4. _“No one truly understands the weight I carry.”_
5. _“If I am not in control, everything will fall apart.”_
6. _“I am not allowed to feel weak or vulnerable.”_
7. _“It is too late for me to live a normal life.”_
8. _“I will never be enough, no matter how hard I try.”_
9. _“If I take a break, everything I’ve worked for will collapse.”_
10. _“Everyone is waiting for me to fail.”_
11. _“I will never live up to my own expectations, let alone anyone else’s.”_

### ### Goals of Treatment

1. **Introduce the CBT and ERP Models**
    
    - Explain the cognitive model of thought patterns and behaviors, focusing on how Sarah's specific symptoms are influenced by her maladaptive beliefs. Use **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** to help her understand the connection between her thoughts, feelings, and actions.
    - Incorporate **Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)** by gradually exposing Sarah to situations that trigger her perfectionist tendencies, while guiding her to resist compulsive behaviors. This will help her tolerate discomfort without resorting to overwork or control.
2. **Identify and Challenge Automatic Thoughts**
    
    - Teach Sarah to recognize her automatic, negative thoughts (e.g., "I will never be enough" or "If I rest, everything will fall apart"). Help her develop more adaptive, balanced ways of thinking.
    - Encourage her to create a more compassionate internal dialogue that reduces the rigid self-criticism tied to her OCPD. This will enable her to approach setbacks with resilience instead of despair.
3. **Develop Relaxation Methods**
    
    - Introduce Sarah to relaxation techniques, such as **mindfulness meditation**, **progressive muscle relaxation**, or **guided imagery**, to help her manage stress and anxiety.
    - Encourage reflection on past mistakes through a lens of self-compassion. These methods will help Sarah cultivate the belief that she deserves rest and that taking breaks is essential, not a sign of failure.
4. **Establish Personal Identity**
    
    - Assist Sarah in forming a personal identity independent of her family’s legacy and shortcomings. Encourage her to explore her own values, interests, and aspirations outside the framework of perfectionism and obligation.
    - Help her reduce the burden of familial expectations by defining goals aligned with her authentic self rather than the pressures imposed by noble responsibilities.
5. **Cease Self-Destructive Behavior and Accept Accountability**
    
    - Work with Sarah to recognize patterns of self-destructive behavior, such as overwork, neglecting her physical health, or suppressing emotions. Encourage her to take responsibility for her well-being without self-punishment.
    - Help her embrace the idea that accountability includes caring for herself and setting boundaries. Teach her that acknowledging vulnerability is not weakness but a strength that fosters growth.

# ### Cognitive and ERP Techniques Used

1. **Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts**
    
    - Situations that triggered unpleasant emotions were recorded alongside Sarah’s day-to-day routine, focusing on the emotional responses and automatic thoughts that accompanied them. In the later stages of treatment, Sarah practiced techniques to challenge and reframe these thoughts.
    - It should be noted, however, that Sarah remained unwilling to adopt regular sleep intervals or utilize her personal space without exposure to her OCPD-driven compulsions.
2. **Gradual Exposure to Imperfection**
    
    - Using ERP, Sarah was systematically exposed to situations where she had to intentionally make minor mistakes or leave tasks incomplete. For example, she was asked to leave small errors in her work or to take breaks despite feeling compelled to keep working.
    - Over time, this exposure helped her build tolerance for imperfection and reduced the anxiety associated with not meeting impossibly high standards.
3. **Thought-Stopping and Replacement Techniques**
    
    - Sarah was taught to recognize intrusive, perfectionist thoughts as soon as they arose and to use **thought-stopping techniques**, such as visualizing a stop sign or saying “stop” aloud. The most effective method that worked is special to her Sarah now walks in circles around a person when they need to stop there perfectionist thoughts.
    - She then practiced replacing these thoughts with more balanced alternatives, such as “I am allowed to rest” or “Doing my best is enough,” helping to shift her focus from rigid perfectionism to self-compassion and flexibility. Which has alowed her with her new Relaxation Method of Fashion Desing to show more self-compassion.

### Conclusion

This case study presented the key tools and strategies used in treating my best friend Sarah’s Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and insomnia, focusing on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and the Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) approach. Together, we made significant strides in improving Sarah’s unconscious behaviors, helping her develop healthier thought patterns and greater resilience.

I would like to acknowledge that this is my first case, and while the results have been fruitful, there is always room for improvement, as noted by my professor. Nonetheless, I am extremely proud of my friend. She now views the world—and herself—through a more compassionate and beautiful lens, a testament to her strength and determination throughout this journey.
