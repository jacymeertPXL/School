### An analysis on the Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) on my friend Sarah

This case concerns a 22-year-old lady of noble birth who exhibits intense Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). This condition stems from her youth, during which she endured constant racism and immense pressure from the noble people around her. I find this case particularly compelling, as she is my personal friend, and we grew up together. Despite having supportive relationships, she continuously pushed herself to boundaries that no child or adult should. This unresolved determination appears to have fueled her pursuit of perfectionism and her efforts to navigate the complex dynamics of other noble houses.

The purpose of this paper is to assist my dear friend by presenting a clear cognitive map of her OCPD and the journey we have undergone together through various therapeutic steps. Over many months, we have worked to address the underlying factors contributing to her condition and have achieved positive results. This paper will focus on the key aspects of her therapy and the progress we have made.

### Literature Review
Standard Beckian Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), also referred to as cognitive therapy (CT), is based on the cognitive model, which posits that thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are interrelated. Dysfunctional cognitions can perpetuate maladaptive behaviors and emotional responses, particularly in patients with rigid and perfectionistic cognitive patterns, as often seen in Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). CT provides a structured, directive, and goal-oriented framework, making it a valuable approach for addressing OCPD’s core cognitive and behavioral features.

The cognitive-behavioral model of OCPD highlights the role of maladaptive core beliefs, such as fears of imperfection, excessive responsibility, and hyper-focus on orderliness and control. These cognitions manifest in behaviors such as over-preparation, procrastination due to perfectionism, and difficulty delegating tasks. Therapists employing CT in OCPD focus on identifying and challenging these beliefs, facilitating more adaptive cognitive and behavioral patterns.

Core principles of CT for OCPD involve recognizing how rigid cognitive processes drive excessive perfectionism and control-oriented behaviors. Therapy aims to help patients identify and reframe dysfunctional thoughts, replacing them with flexible, realistic cognitions. Behavioral experiments and exposure techniques are often employed to address avoidance behaviors and reinforce functional responses to feared situations, such as tolerating imperfection or delegating tasks.

In addition to CT, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is an evidence-based therapeutic approach commonly used to target obsessive-compulsive tendencies and rigid behavioral patterns. While traditionally associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), ERP can also be adapted for OCPD to help patients confront and tolerate discomfort associated with relinquishing control or embracing imperfection. ERP involves systematically exposing patients to situations or outcomes that trigger distress and guiding them to resist the compulsion to over-control or perfect the situation.

The integration of ERP into OCPD treatment focuses on gradually reducing reliance on rigid routines or perfectionistic behaviors. For example, patients may practice leaving a task “unfinished” or intentionally delegating work to others without interference. Over time, ERP helps to desensitize patients to the anxiety caused by these situations, allowing for greater flexibility in thoughts and behaviors.

The goals of CT and ERP for OCPD include fostering cognitive flexibility, reducing the need for excessive control, and promoting healthier interpersonal functioning. By developing strategies to balance perfectionistic tendencies with realistic expectations and addressing the emotional distress associated with rigidity, patients can achieve a better quality of life. Empirical evidence suggests that combining CT and ERP can improve outcomes by addressing both the cognitive and behavioral aspects of OCPD, such as reducing interpersonal conflicts and improving time management and decision-making skills.
